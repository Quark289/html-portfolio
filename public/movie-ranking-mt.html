<h3>ALIEN 2</h3>
<p>Synopsis : Lt. Ripley's space ship is recover by another team. She wakes up with making the same nightmares in a space station. Hi bosses ask here to come back on LV-426 because they have any news from a colony. After some resistance, she accepts the deal and with a marine team.The new mission was to find any survivant and eradicate these monsters.But, things will not go in right way ... it's not a colony anymore but a monster nest</p>
<p>I love everything in this movie. The sound fx and the story are good. The arrival on the planet is a master piece.Alien's movie creates a heavy atmosphere and you are afraid for every protagonist. Imagines this story is true and you make this encounter … Frightening. Remember: In space no one can hear you scream.</p>

<h3>TERMINATOR 1</h3>
<p>Synopsis: A human soldier is sent from 2029 to 1984 to stop an almost indestructible cyborg killing machine, sent from the same year, which has been programmed to execute a young woman whose unborn son is the key to humanity's future salvation.</p>
<p>I see this movie when I was young. I was impressed by the cyborg and the story. You live a peaceful life and someone tell you will be executed by a robot and your son will be the Savor of humanity. I love this dark atmosphere and this hunt from start to end. You stop your breath for Sarah Connor and ask for yourself: how is she can destroy this war machine?</p>

<h3>STAR WARS - IV -*- V -*- VI -</h3>
<p>Synopsis: The Imperial Forces -- under orders from cruel Darth Vader (David Prowse) -- hold Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) hostage, in their efforts to quell the rebellion against the Galactic Empire. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford), captain of the Millennium Falcon, work together with the companionable droid duo R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) to rescue the beautiful princess, help the Rebel Alliance, and restore freedom and justice to the Galaxy.</p>
<p>Every Christmas, this trilogy was my favourite moment. French television makes it happen and if think again, it’s only for a dark purpose: Looking stars wars few weeks before Christmas, come on Georges, it’s an evil plan. At the end, it’s like turn on speed light and you are in another world.</p>
